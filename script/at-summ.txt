3 Key Lessons from Atomic Habits
This section of the Atomic Habits summary presents key points from three of the core themes of the book. 

Lesson 1: Small habits make a big difference

It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. 

Lesson 2: Forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead. 

Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.

If you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.


Lesson 3: Build identity-based habits

The key to building lasting habits is focusing on creating a new identity first. Your current behaviors are simply a reflection of your current identity. What you do now is a mirror image of the type of person you believe that you are (either consciously or subconsciously).
